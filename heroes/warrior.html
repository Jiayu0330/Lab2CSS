        <li>"As one of the most formidable warriors Azeroth has ever seen, the things Garrosh brings to the table include war axes, plenty of bloodthirsty minions, and severe anger management issues. That's not hyperbole - Garrosh's deck literally thrives on dealing AND receiving damage. And don't be surprised if Garrosh makes his minions charge right at you in a blood-fueled craze."</li>
