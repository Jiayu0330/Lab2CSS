        <li>"Music soothes the savage beast, and to Rexxar's ears there can be no sweeter music than the sound of his beast miniors tearing into their prey. He's deep and paradoxical, is what we're saying. Rexxar has access to buffs that turn even meek minions into fearsom killing machines, and he takes down whatever targets his beasts leave for him with his quiver full of direct damage spells. The hunt is on!"</li>
