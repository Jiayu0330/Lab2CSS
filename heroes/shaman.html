        <li>What's the next logical step after single-handedly saving the world from utter destruction for, like, the umpteenth time? Sit down and play some cards, of course! Thrall's deck is a merry bag of assorted buffs, damage spells, healing spells, and some tough minions to round things out. Expect to be surprised when going up against the Horde's former warchief and his well-balanced arsenal of spells and minions." </li>
